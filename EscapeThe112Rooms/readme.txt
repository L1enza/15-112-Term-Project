# 15-112 Term Project: Escape the 112 Rooms

This is my 15-112 term project: **Escape the 112 Rooms**.

## Overview
Escape the 112 Rooms is a **first-person horror game** built from scratch using a custom raycasting engine to simulate 3D graphics within a 2D grid-based world. 
The game combines procedural map generation, intelligent enemy AI, and immersive gameplay mechanics to create a tense, puzzle-like escape experience.

## Key Features
- **Custom Raycasting Engine**  
  Simulates 3D graphics on a 2D grid, enabling a first-person perspective.
- **Procedural Map Generation**  
  Uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to generate solvable and varied level layouts.
- **Intelligent Enemy AI**  
  Implements **A\*** pathfinding for dynamic pursuit and challenging gameplay.
- **Modular, Object-Oriented Design**  
  Game logic is organized into reusable components for scalability and clarity.
- **Interactive Gameplay**  
  Includes real-time input handling, collectibles, and escape logic.
- **Classic Engine Simulation Techniques**  
  Applied algorithmic thinking and low-level rendering approaches to mimic early 3D engines.


Enjoy :-)
